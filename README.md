A collection of [Processing](https://processing.org) sketches implemented in [Clojure](https://clojure.org)/[Quil](http://www.quil.info).

## Run

To execute a sketch in Emacs/Cider:

1. Open the file with the sketch.
2. Run cider: `M-x cider-jack-in`.
3. Evaluate the buffer with the sketch using `C-c C-k`.
4. (Optionally) modify functions, for example `draw` and reevaluate only that function using `C-c C-e`. You should see the changes after that.
